# covid-19-predictions
A prediction of the covid-19 pandemic development

Goal of the project:

After the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Hubei (China), the World Health Organization recently declared the corona virus disease COVID-19 a pandemic. The goal of this project is to use publicly available data to accelerate scientific innovation in modeling and forecasting the evolution of COVID-19 cases in different countries as well as to evaluate possible response measures. Quantifying the forecast accuracy and uncertainty in real time is used as a benchmark for epidemic forecasting models and hopefully can provide additional insights into the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics.
